# Student-Record-System

<h1>Project Abstract</h1>

The Student Record System will be a database-driven program designed to efficiently manage and secure student data. It serves as a comprehensive tool for educational institutions to store, retrieve, update, and delete student information. This system will be constructed using basic programming concepts of C till file handling

Key functionalities of the Student Record System will Include:

<b><u>1. Adding Student Details:</u></b> Users can input and store essential information about students, such as their first name, last name, roll number, CGPA, and registered courses.

<b><u>2. Retrieving Student Data:</u></b> The system provides multiple retrieval options, allowing users to find student data by roll number, first name, or course ID.

<b><u>3. Total Number of Students:</u></b> Users can easily ascertain the total number of students registered in a specific course, aiding in course management.

<b><u>4. Updating Student Data:</u></b> Existing student records can be updated using their respective roll numbers, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

<b><u>5. Deleting Student Data:</u></b> Students' records can be securely deleted from the database, providing a mechanism to manage student records efficiently.

<b><u>6.Total Number of Students:</u></b> The system offers a feature to display the total number of registered students, offering insights into the student population.

The user interacts with the system by selecting options, each associated with a specific operation. These options will be presented in a clear and organized manner, simplifying user navigation:
Our current plan is including these options

1. Add the details of the student
2. Find the details of the student by using roll number
3. Find the details of the student by using first name
4. Find the details of the student by using the course ID
5. Update the details of the student by using the roll number
6. Delete the details of the student by using the roll number
7. Find the total number of students
8. Exit

This project is supposed to help institutions get a record of student information and academic portfolios and safeguard it.

This project is currently on a working basis and more features may be added for better use of the application.
